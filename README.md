# Baby Bam Bam

As babies smash on the keyboard, images, letters and numbers appear on
the screen. Try the many options and find the ones that are right for your baby.
On chrome fullscreen mode locks keyboard commands like ALT+F4 or tab switching, making it
harder to accidently exit the program.

No dependencies (outside of Google Fonts) only vanilla html/css/javascript.
